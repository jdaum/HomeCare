HomeCare is an Android application for nurses working in a home care environment. The app supports narrative note taking for nurses. Its goal is to improve note taking for nurses by reducing the time and error rate. The application allows the user to define and manage so called stock answers, sentences that repeatedly appear in the narrative notes of a patient. Using these stock answers the nurse can save patient information more quickly and accurately. This gives the nurse more time to care for the patient. Depending on the nurse’s environment, our application provides a broad range of flexibility concerning the input methods. Besides the stock answers, the nurse can use voice input and typing to complete the patient’s information. If the nurse wants to recall information, there are four possibilities depending on what type of information is needed. The nurse can search for information in our application using a specific time block or a body system. As well as search for information by nurse name and recall last 4 hours information.
